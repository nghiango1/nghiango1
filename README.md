### Hi there üëã

I start coding in my high school year (2012) and quickly reach national level in Academic and achieved 3rd pride in "K√¨ thi ch·ªçn h·ªçc sinh gi·ªèi qu·ªëc gia trung h·ªçc ph·ªï th√¥ng Tin h·ªçc" in VietNam (2014) (which identifying top talent of Vietnam to compete in [International Science Olympiads in Informatics](https://ioinformatics.org/)). I love to learn everything from the core and the last 10 years have never stop self studying from every aspect of coding: From data structures, algorithms, low level language asm/c/c++, security,... to the lastest technology advancement like Python/Machine Learning/AI (math included) or microservice architecture/networking/API driven.

While I know and can leverage a lot of existing tools (VM, Cloud, Container...), I have alway want to be the one who shape and build them. I using `Golang` more and more at the moment as a lot of tool chains in field shifting toward them. After have fullfill the military service obligation as system admin in one of largest Govement Datacenter in Vietnam, I love to invest my profession as a Developer to pursue my passion for coding once more.

Check out my latest project, where I building a new interpreter language in golang - Interingo, with a full LSP, Code highlighter for neovim on a [live websitte here](https://nghiango.asia/).
